# CST1510-FinalCoursework
This project is based on designing and implementing a ‘Vending Machine’ for sushi. It is a Client/Server-Side software system built in Python to interact with the user on the client-side and the data storage is processed on the server-side. The vending machine under the name of  ‘ケシャフ sushi’(Keshav in Japanese) will allow the user to carry out the following operations when generating an order.
1)	Start with a welcome message.
2)	Choose sushi according to a category and then, he/she will have to enter the quantity the latter wish to purchase.
3)	A window will display the sushi ID, sushi’s name, individual price, and the total price.
4)	After each order place, the vending machine will allow the following list of options:
a.	Add Another
b.	Finish and Pay
c.	Cancel
5)	Add Another operation will allow the user to add another sushi to his/her cart.
6)	Finish and Pay will display the final receipt containing the list of items, individual price, total price and proceed to make the payment.
7)	Cancel will display a message and go back to the Welcome window.
8)	The user can make payment either by cash or card. If payment is done by cash, then the change will also be displayed.
9)	Finally, after payment, a goodbye message will be displayed and redirecting the user back to the welcome message.
